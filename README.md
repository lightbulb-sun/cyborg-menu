# Cyborg Hunter (SMS) Weapons Menu Hack

## Changes
Makes the following change
to the Sega Master System game
*Cyborg Hunter*
in accordance with a 2015 post by user FeRcHuLeS
in the romhacking.net thread
*Hack ideas: for those without the skill but with all the ideas*:

By default, the game needs a second controller
to access the weapons menu.
With this hack, the `[Pause]` button can also be used to open it.
In exchange, the game can no longer be paused.

## Download
The latest release can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/lightbulb-sun/cyborg-menu/releases).
Patch the original ROM with one of the `.bsdiff`, `.ips` or `.bps` files
to create the hack.
